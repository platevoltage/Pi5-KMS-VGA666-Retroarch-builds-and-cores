# Pi5-KMS-VGA666-Retroarch-builds-and-cores

I converted an old SEGA Areo City cabinet to use a Raspberry Pi, along with a Gert VGA 666 board for video output to the 15khz 320 x 240 CRT display. Pre built anything was very hard to find for some reason, so I've greated a repository for my configuration. Please use anything here that works. If you notice a core or binary being out of date, just let me know and I will see about updating. All of the cores included here are very usable on the Pi 5 with every game that I've tried.
